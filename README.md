# GASP+ALS with Inventory Integration  
ðŸš€ **REPLICATED & BLUEPRINT-ONLY** ðŸš€  
*(Fully Networked - No C++ Required!)*  

## About This Project  
This repository is a **fork** of PolygonHive's GASP+ALS, with additional **Inventory System functionality** integrated.  

- Looking for the **original GAS+ALS system**? Check out [PolygonHiveâ€™s GitHub](https://github.com/PolygonHive/GASP-ALS).  
- Want an **enhanced version** with inventory mechanics? Youâ€™re in the right place!  
- âš¡ **Fully replicated for multiplayer games** (supports networking).  
- ðŸ›  **Blueprint-Only**â€”No C++ required!  

## Features Added in This Fork  
âœ” **Fully Integrated Inventory System**  
âœ” **Supports Pickup & Item Management**  
âœ” **Modular Structure for Easy Expansion**  
âœ” **Overlay System Adjustments for Inventory Compatibility**  
âœ” **Multiplayer-Compatible (Replication Ready!)**  
âœ” **100% Blueprint-Based Implementation**  

### **ðŸ”§ Inventory System Overview**  
#### **ðŸ“Œ Character Inventory Updates**  
- `CBP_Character` now includes `BPI_Inventory`, enabling the `"Pickup"` function.  
- Inventory-related functionality can be found **inside the event graph** of `CBP_Character`.  
- All additional inventory mechanics are organized within the `"Inventory"` folder.  

#### **ðŸ“Œ Overlay System Adjustments**  
- Inside `"Overlay System" â†’ "Overlays" â†’ "DataAssets"`, the `"Pistol"` asset has been **modified**.  
- Some internal data was **wiped** to ensure compatibility with inventory mechanics.  
- **If reusing the Overlay System**, check these files to confirm integration.  

### **ðŸ›  How The Inventory System Works**  
**Adding New Items:**  
1. Navigate to `Content â†’ Inventory â†’ DT_Inventory`.  
2. Add new items by modifying the **Data Table (`DT_Inventory`)**.  

**Placing Pickup Items in the Game:**  
1. Go to `Content â†’ Inventory â†’ Blueprints`.  
2. Locate `BP_Pickup` and place it in the level.  
3. Open the `"Details"` tab and set the **ID** to match an item from `DT_Inventory`.
